        <p><strong>As the world awaits the coronation of a new Oba of Benin, in Benin City, there has been a barrage of goodwill messages from distant and near lands.</strong> Two of such empathic correspondence unveil the kind of royal diplomacy now being ushered in as a new dawn approaches in the nucleus of the former seat of a great West African empire (Kingdom), the former capital of Midwest region and capital of Bendel now Edo State in modern Nigeria. From the records of the Benin Traditional Council (BTC), the queen of Great Britain, Her Majesty Elizabeth 11 sent her condolence message to the Crown Prince and Heir Apparent to the Benin throne, Ambassador Eheneden Erediauwa, over the transition of Omo N‚ÄôOba N‚ÄôEdo Uku Akpolokpolo Erediauwa, CFR. Oba of Benin.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the Duke of Kent, His Royal Highness, Prince Edward, KG, GCMG, GCVO, ADC (P), a cousin of  Her Majesty, the Queen, has since expressed his best wishes for the Benin kingdom in a most brotherly fashion imbued with the grandest of aristocratic solidarity. Among other kind words, Queen Elizabeth said in her terse message conveyed through the British High Commissioner to Nigeria Mr. Paul Arkwright: ‚Äú‚Ä¶We take solace in the knowledge that his reign was peaceful, and witnessed a strengthening of the relationship and good friendship between the people of Benin Kingdom and the UK‚Äù</p>

        <h3>High profile royal events</h3>

        <p>Before now, the newer period of the Benin Kingdom had witnessed high profile royal events such as the unprecedented visit of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 11 to Benin to meet with His Royal Majesty Oba Akenzua in 1956, following that of the Earl of Plymouth who had also earlier visited Oba Akenzua in 1938.</p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crown Prince Eheneden Set To Be Installed as the New Oba Of Benin <a href="https://t.co/RVXmk7KtUU">https://t.co/RVXmk7KtUU</a></p>&mdash; Kelvin dozie (@KelvinDozie15) <a href="https://twitter.com/KelvinDozie15/status/749357019015118848">July 2, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        <p>The children and grandchildren of the District Officer in Benin City then W.B. Rumman who gave a moving outline of the coronation of Prince Aiguabasimwin (Oba Eweka 11) in 1914 would still marvel today at the sustenance of royal court rites which Oba Eweka n‚ÄôOlogbe revived after the interregnum brought about by the events of 1897.</p>

        <p>But even with the many more exchanges of messages and visitation by emissaries from the UK Royal Family and government over the years, this renewed communication in our era, is a testimony to the ascendant relations between the British Royal Family and the Benin Royal Family. It is a march of international cooperation powered by both old and contemporary royal ties.</p>
